TESTING OVERVIEW

Karma is command line tool that acts as engine running tests. Spawns a web server and executes test. 
Jasmine is used for writing the actual tests. 

To run tests: ./node_modules/karma/bin/karma start


KARMA

Karma configuration file is at /karma.conf.js
	-Tells karma what to do when run
	-contains path for all test files (currently anything in test folder that ends with .test.js

To make a new Karma config file: ./node_modules/karma/bin/karma init
	-Shouldn't have to do this again, just documenting
	-It will ask you some questions about what browsers to capture, where test files are located, etc

To add new test files:
	-Add file in tests folder
	-Name should end in .test.js to be picked up by karma.conf.js


JASMINE 

-describe() groups tests together
-it() defines Individual Tests
-make assertions 
	-expect(func).toHaveBeenCalled();
	-expect(2+2).toEqual(4)
