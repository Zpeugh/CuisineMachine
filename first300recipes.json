The only little black bits you want are from the vanilla bean! Then slice them into 1/2 inch pieces and place them in a container.; 2; Add 10g of brown sugar, the vanilla bean and orange peel to the container. Close the lid and shake. Place in the fridge for 3 hours or overnight. The juices from the rhubarb will be extracted. Because of this, you want to make sure you don’t add any liquids or juice to the container.; 3; When you’re ready to bake, preheat the oven at 180C.; 4; Crumble: Place the white flour and sugar into a mixing bowl. Slice the soft butter (room temperature) into small pieces and use your hands to mix in the butter with the sugar and flour. Knead it like it’s dough until chunks start to form. The warmth from your hands will also soften the butter and make the mixture combine more easily.; 5; Take the rhubarb mixture and strain out the liquids into another bowl (you can boil the juice down into a syrup to pour over the crumble!). The reason why you must separate the juice is because the rhubarb will continue to release water during the cooking process. Keep the orange peel and vanilla with the rhubarb and place into a baking dish (they can be removed when you eat! This way, the flavours are cooked altogether).; 6; Add the crumble on top to cover the surface. Cook for 30 minutes or until golden brown.",

To my big surprise, the blog is in Romanian language and I had no clue what to do. But thanks to Google Translate the problem was quickly solved. I changed the recipe to my liking: I added some more spices and reduced butter and eggs. And although mine Duchess Potatoes don't look as half as pretty as the original does, but they were super delicious!!!

I have tried the recipe both by baking  it in the oven and by dehydration method, and I personally prefer them in the dehydrator.  Yes the oven method is a heck of a lot quicker method, but it is well worth the wait to prepare them in the dehydrator. And besides, you don’t lose all the important nutrients  you receive when making Kale chips in the dehydrator. Another plus is that if you know someone who’s an anti-veggie this is the perfect snack to get them so that palate is not so discriminatory :)",

                "instructions": "1; First make hallabong curd –If you’d like to make smooth curd, place a mesh strainer over a bowl and set aside.; 2; In a medium saucepan, place the hallabong juice (or tangerine-orange juice) over medium heat. Let it reduce to 1/4 cup, which should take about 3-5 minutes. Pour into a measuring cup to cool, and add the orange zest and lemon juice.; 3; In a medium bowl, whisk together the sugar, the egg, the egg yolks, and the salt.; 4; When the hallabong reduction has cooled to room temperature, whisk it into the egg mixture in a steady stream.; 5; Cook over low-medium heat, whisking constantly, until the mixture thickens to a pudding-like thickness. It’s done when you are able to lift the whisk from the pan, and the mixture holds its shape when it falls back into the saucepan. This should take 6-8 minutes, and the curd should reach 180 degrees.; 6; Remove from heat. For smooth curd, press through the strainer, or leave zest in if you like it stronger. Stir in butter until well-combined.; 7; Once strained, store the hallabong curd in the refrigerator until it is cool. Place a sheet of plastic-wrap over the top, so it doesn’t get a weird rubbery skin.; 8; Next make a panini with nutella and orange curd – Spread about 1 tablespoon of nutella and one tablespoon of orange curd on a slice of bread. More can be added to your taste preferences. Top with other slice of bread.; 9; Make your panini in a Foreman Grill or a panini press, for the greatest ease and crunch. Alternatively, place a small pat of butter in a skillet over medium heat, and swirl to cover pan. When the butter ceases foaming, place your sandwich in the skillet. Weigh down the sandwich with a heavy small pan, if you wish, to make it more panini-like. Flip the sandwich when the bottom is golden brown. Remove from heat when the bottom is crunchy and golden brown.; 10; Cut into quarters and serve while warm. Enjoy for teatime or as a rich breakfast. A vanilla tea like Mariage Freres Bourbon Vanilla or a good Earl Grey goes wonderfully with the citrus and chocolate notes.",

Reduce heat, and simmer until juices are dark purple and grapes begin to break apart, about 3 minutes.; 13; Pass mixture through a food mill. If you have a fine sieve or chinois, pass the mixture through that.  If you’re too poor (like me), you can use cheesecloth draped over a strainer.  The point is to keep the pureed pits and skins out, you want pure juice here.  Once you get it into the bowl set in the icebath, stir until completely cool.

Grease and flour three 9-inch round cake pans and place a round of parchment paper inside each pan.; 3; Over a large sheet of waxed paper, sift together the flour, baking powder, and salt. Set aside.; 4; In the bowl of an electric mixer fitted with the flat beater, beat the butter on medium speed until smooth and creamy, 1 minute. Add the sugar in a slow, steady stream and beat until the mixture is light and fluffy, 4 to 5 minutes; stop the mixer occasionally and scrape down the sides of the bowl. Add the eggs 1 at a time, beating well after each addition. Continue beating until fluffy, white and increased in volume, 3 to 4 minutes; stop the mixer occasionally to scrape down the sides of the bowl. Beat in the vanilla.

Spoon about 1 cup of the chocolate batter into the middle ring. Gently lift the ring out of the pan and scrape any remaining plain batter from the ring into the large bowl of plain batter; scrape any chocolate batter into the bowl of chocolate batter. Then place the ring in the second pan and repeat the procedure with the plain and chocolate batters.; 7; For the third cake pan, reverse the procedure: place the ring in the pan and spoon the chocolate batter into the outer and center rings. Spoon about 1 cup of the plain batter into the middle ring. It's important that each layer have approximately the same amount of batter so that they are the same thickness when baked. Gently lift the ring out of the pan and scrape any remaining plain batter from the ring into the other circles of batter, if needed to even out the layers. Do the same with any remaining chocolate batter, if needed.; 8; Set the pans on the same rack in the oven, if possible, and bake until the tops of the cakes spring back when gently pressed without leaving an impression, 25 to 30 minutes. The chocolate cake will done a bit sooner than the plain; that's okay. Do not over bake, or the chocolate cake will be dry. Transfer the pans to wire racks and cool for 10 minutes. Tap gently to see if the cakes are releasing from the sides. Place another rack on top of one cake pan, invert, and carefully remove the pan. Place the other rack on the cake again and invert right-side up. Follow the same procedure for the other two cakes. Cool the cakes completely before assembling and frosting. Serves 10 to 12.; 9; To make the frosting, in a food processor combine the confectioner's sugar, salt, and butter and process to combine. Add the milk and vanilla and process until smooth. Add the chocolate and process until well blended, smooth, and creamy. Use the frosting immediately.; 10; To create the checkerboard effect, stack the cake layers so the outside colors alternate. The frosting between each layer should be thin enough to complete the checkerboard pattern. To assemble the cake, place a cake layer, bottom side up, on a cake circle and spread about 2/3 cup frosting all the way to the edges of the layer. Place a second layer, top side up, on top and spread about 2/3 cup frosting all the way to the edges of the layer. Place the third layer on top, top side up, and spread the remaining frosting on the sides and top. Decorate the cake as desired.",

Sprinkle each layer generously with salt. Continue to layer the slices until finished.  Allow the eggplant to drain in the sink for a minimum of 30 minutes but you can allow to sit longer while you prepare the sauce.; 2; Make the sauce: Heat the olive oil in a saucepan or skillet over medium heat.  Add in the garlic and pinch of hot pepper flakes (if using). Cook until garlic is fragrant being careful to not let brown – about 30 seconds to 1 minute.  Add in the diced tomatoes.  Allow the sauce to come to a simmer. Cook until the tomatoes break down and the sauce thickens  - about 20 minutes. (Allow the sauce to become thick and chunky so the finished dish is not too watery.) Once thickened, season with salt and freshly ground black pepper. Chiffonade a few basil leaves (roll lengthwise and cut into little slices.) Stir to combine. Taste and adjust any seasonings.; 3; Roast the eggplant:  While the sauce is cooking, preheat the oven to 425 degrees Fahrenheit.  Lightly coat 2 sheet pans with olive oil. Rinse and dry the eggplant slices. Lay the slices on the pan and brush he tops with additional olive oil. Sprinkle with salt and freshly ground pepper.  Bake until soft and golden, about 20 minutes. Check half way through and turn slices. Remove from oven. Allow to cool until possible to handle. Maintain oven temperature.; 4; Assemble and bake:  In a baking dish, spread a thin layer of the tomato sauce on the bottom. Layer about 1/3 of the eggplant slices over the tomato sauce.  Spread with another thin layer of tomato sauce. Sprinkle with about 1/3 of the mozzarella and a dusting of Parmigiano. Repeat with the remaining eggplant, tomato sauce and cheeses. I give the top an extra dusting of Parmigiano.  Bake until the cheese has melted and the sauce is nice and bubbly, about 25 minutes.; 5; Allow the dish to rest for about 15 minutes before serving.

                "about": "Syllabub is the great-great-grandfather of Irish Coffee As a contributor noted on the delightful “Diary of Samuel Pepys” (with daily entries from Pepys 17th C diary and modern commentary) “Syllabub was a popular dessert in seventeenth, eighteenth and early nineteenth century England. It was popular for celebrations, special occasions and holidays due to its festive appearance. Many original recipes survive with various modes of preparation. Generally Syllabub was made with a mixture of whipped cream, whipped egg whites, white wine, sugar, lemon juice and zest of lemon. \" “The quantity of white wine used dramatically alters the finished dish, allowing the cook to produce either a creamy dessert or a thick, rich punch. Drinkers of the punch, easily identified by a milky white mustache, would be equally pleased if the white wine were replaced with cider, though they’d also be satisfied with a dash or two of sherry. “In the seventeenth century, a milkmaid would send a stream of new, warm milk directly from a cow into a bowl of spiced cider or ale. A light curd would form on top with a lovely whey underneath. This, according to Elizabeth David, was the original syllabub. Today’s syllabub is more solid (its origins can also be traced to the seventeenth century, albeit to the upper classes) and mixes sherry and/or brandy, sugar, lemon, nutmeg, and double cream into a custard-like dessert or an eggnog-like beverage, depending upon the cook.” Syllabub (from Sir Kenelm Digby's The Closet of Sir Kenelm Digby Knight Opened): My Lady Middlesex makes Syllabubs for little Glasses with spouts, thus. Take 3 pints of sweet Cream, one of quick white wine (or Rhenish), and a good wine glassful (better the 1/4 of a pint) of Sack: mingle with them about three quarters of a pound of fine Sugar in Powder. Beat all these together with a whisk, till all appeareth converted into froth. Then pour it into your little Syllabub-glasses, and let them stand all night. The next day the Curd will be thick and firm above, and the drink clear under it. I conceive it may do well, to put into each glass (when you pour the liquor into it) a sprig of Rosemary a little bruised, or a little Limon-peel, or some such thing to quicken the taste; or use Amber-sugar, or spirit of Cinnamon, or of Lignum-Cassiæ; or Nutmegs, or Mace, or Cloves, a very little. From \"The London Art Of Cookery and Domestic Housekeepers' Complete Assistant\", 1811 by John Farley. Whipt Syllabubs Rub a lump of loaf sugar on the outside of a lemon, put it into a pint of thin cream, and sweeten it to the taste. Then put in the juice of a lemon, and a glass of Madeira wine or French brandy. Mill it to a froth with a chocolate mill, and take it off as it rises, and lay it into a hair sieve. Then fill one half of the glasses a little more than half full with white wine, and the other half of the glasses a little more than half full with red wine: lay on the froth as high as possible ; but take care that it is well drained on a sieve, otherwise it will mix with the wine, and the syllabub will be thereby spoiled.",

You will notice the mixture start to become warmer and smoother. It may take 10-20 minutes of this process  in order for the mixture to become completely smooth (so smooth that it will stick to the roof of your mouth when eating it), which is the consistency that I prefer.; 4; Lastly, add some spices or other ingredients to taste.

They use full cream milk plus they add extra cream to make the full dairy content required to be classified as \"Real Dairy\" ice cream.

Remove from water, and puree in a blender with 1/2 cup soaking liquid.; 2; Heat a large heavy pot over high heat. Add 2 tablespoons oil. Season beef with 2 1/2 teaspoons salt and 1/2 teaspoon pepper. Brown beef in batches, adding more oil as needed, about 10 minutes. Transfer to a plate.; 3; Add remaining tablespoon oil, the onions, garlic, and minced chiles to pot, and cook over medium-high heat until onions are translucent, about 5 minutes. (If the pan gets too dark, add a little water, and scrape up browned bits with a wooden spoon to deglaze.) Add cumin and oregano, and cook, stirring constantly, until fragrant, 30 seconds to 1 minute.; 4; Stir in browned beef and chile puree. Add tomato puree, water, and 1/2 teaspoon salt. Bring to a boil. Reduce heat, and simmer gently, partially covered, until meat is very tender and juices are thick, 2 1/2 to 3 hours. (Check pot once an hour for excessive evaporation; if chili seems dry, add a little water.) Season chili with salt, and stir in vinegar.

                "instructions": "1; Break the eggs into a bowl and whisk them. Don't beat them and don't whisk them to a froth. Just make them smooth in the bowl. Because the eggs are the only rising material in the mixture, this maneuver is better underdone than overdone.; 2; Then mix everything together well in a big container. As the mixture may be difficult to combine with a spoon, there is no objection to going in with your hands and really giving it a larruping.; 3; This done, turn your attention to the pudding bag. Soak the cotton square in warm water and wring it relatively dry. Lay it flat on the kitchen table and flour the top side well. This will form a moist coating of flour on the cloth which is essential to removing the pudding from the bag later. Shake off excess flour.; 4; Now dump the pudding mixture in the center of the cloth. The mixture will not be too \"loose\" and will remain pretty much upright in a blob. Gather the corners and edges of the cloth up around the mixture to form the \"bag\" around the pudding and tie off the pudding. Make allowance for some rising (the eggs) and some swelling during cooking. In short, don't tie the bag completely tight about the mixture, but leave a small emptiness between the string and the pudding. If you do it right, the ultimate pudding will have the form of a flattened orb, swelling to the precise size you have left in the bag. If you leave too much space, the pudding will sag.; 5; Leave a loop in the string so you can thrust in the handle of a long wooden spoon to retrieve the finished pudding from the boiling water. Everything is going to be wicked hot when the time comes, and the loop is a must. Also, tie the knot around the bag so it can be easily untied.; 6; Boil in a bag for one hour.; 7; It is all right to add water during the cooking, but don't let the boiling stop at any time.; 8; Serve the pudding with warm custard.",

Once the chicken is completely cooked pour it in to a collander and allow all the water to run off. You will not want any moisture in or on the chicken.  It will gather moisture when we wrap it with our dough. While the chicken is draining cut your dough in to 5X5 inch squares. Cover each with butter LIGHTLY!  Sprinkle brown sugar on top of the butter.. to your taste.  Place chicken in the middle of each square and roll as you would a crossaint.  Place on a cookie tray and bake at 350 degrees until golden brown on top and bottom.  Brush butter on with a pastry brush.  Serve with Apple Butter dip.....YUMMY!",

I mean, c'mon, how gorgeous is that color and oh so tender &  juicy!!!; 6; For the warm cabbage slaw... Into a large pan, over medium heat, add a couple drizzles of olive oil, the onions and coleslaw mix. Toss to combine and allow to cook a few minutes, until the veggies are slightly softened and have a bit of color. Add in a ladle full of the cooking water form the corned beed (watch you don't get the peppercorns) and simmer for a few minutes. The liquid will be absorbed. Season with a little pepper.",

The head of garlic should still remain intact.; 12; Slice off the pointy end of the bulb to expose all the cloves.; 13; Place in a small greased ramekin and cover with the olive oil.; 14; Sprinkle just a pinch of salt and cover with aluminum foil.; 15; Place in oven and roast for about 45 minutes.; 16; The cloves of garlic will be all nice and soft.; 17; To caramelize the onions:  Place a tablespoon of olive oil in large sauté pan over medium heat.; 18; Add the onion slices.; 19; Don’t stir too often yet.; 20; Let the pieces brown, without getting burnt.; 21; After about 15 minutes or so, once slices have mostly browned, I like to turn the heat down to low or medium low.; 22; Stir frequently.; 23; I like adding a bit of water or oil every so often to keep the pieces from burning or sticking too much.; 24; After about 40 minutes or so, the onions should have a dark brown, jam-like quality.; 25; To assemble the sandwiches:  Place slices of cheddar and Monterey Jack cheeses on slice of bread.; 26; Place pieces of roasted broccoli on top, followed by some caramelized onions.; 27; Sprinkle Parmesan cheese on top.  Spread clove or two of roasted garlic on the top piece of bread.; 28; Butter both sides of the sandwich and place on greased griddle.; 29; Once one side has turned golden brown, flip and let the other side develop a golden brown color.; 30; Once the sandwich has cooled a bit, use the cookie cutter to cut out the whale-shape.",
                "about": "This weekend, our town, Dana Point, is hosting its annual Festival of Whales!  We celebrate with cheesy things like a town parade featuring a giant whale balloon, a sprawling block party, and all kinds of whale and marine themed activities in the harbor.  It’s actually a lot of fun, and one of the reasons we really dig living in Dana Point.  So we figured we’d run with the whole cheesiness theme, and whale theme, by making whale-shaped grilled cheese sandwiches!  Or, to be more accurate, vaguely-whale shaped grilled cheese sandwiches (That little broccoli floret is supposed to be an eye)…Of course, since we like to experiment when we cook, we added things like roasted broccoli and garlic as well as caramelized onions.  We also like to get both nice creamy cheeses like Jack in there along with sharp cheeses like extra-sharp cheddar and parmesan.  I have to say, it’s one of the best grilled cheeses I’ve ever had.  And I’ve had a lot…",
